  The executor instrumentation ensures that context is automatically carried across threads by
  wrapping common Java executors (e.g., Executor, ExecutorService, ForkJoinPool). When a task is
  submitted, the current context is captured and bound to the task. Then, when the task eventually
  runs, even if itâ€™s on a different thread, the instrumentation reactivates that context, enabling
  consistent correlation across concurrent and asynchronous workflows.
