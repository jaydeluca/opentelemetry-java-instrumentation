  The executor instrumentation ensures that context is automatically carried across threads by
  instrumenting common Java executors (e.g., Executor, ExecutorService, ForkJoinPool). When a task
  is submitted, the current context is captured and bound to the task. When the task eventually
  runs, the instrumentation reactivates that context, even if itâ€™s on a different thread.
