  Collects and reports key metrics exposed through Java Management Extensions (JMX). By registering
  JMX MBeans and polling their attributes, it automatically extracts JVM and application-level
  telemetry data such as memory usage, thread counts, and garbage collection statistics, and then
  translates these measurements into OpenTelemetry metrics.
