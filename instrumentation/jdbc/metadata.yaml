description: >
  The JDBC instrumentation provides database client spans and metrics. Each call produces a span
  named after the SQL verb, enriched with standard DB client attributes (system, database,
  operation, sanitized statement, peer address) and error details if an exception occurs.

  The instrumentation requires unwrapping pooled connections (via java.sql.Wrapper) to correctly
  attribute database operations to the underlying connection and to cache metadata. If your connection
  pool doesn't support unwrapping, the instrumentation may have degraded performance or increased
  overhead with some JDBC drivers, as metadata extraction may result in database queries on every
  operation depending on driver implementation and caching behavior.

  There is also a "jdbc-datasource" instrumentation that creates spans for datasource connections,
  but is disabled by default due to the volume of telemetry produced.
