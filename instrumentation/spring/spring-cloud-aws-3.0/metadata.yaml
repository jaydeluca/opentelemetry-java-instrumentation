  This instrumentation provides tracing for Spring Cloud AWS SQS, versions 3.0.0 and newer.
  It augments the existing AWS SDK 2.2 instrumentation by providing higher-level tracing for SQS
  operations, capturing details specific to Spring Cloud AWS SQS usage and linking them to the
  underlying AWS SDK traces.
