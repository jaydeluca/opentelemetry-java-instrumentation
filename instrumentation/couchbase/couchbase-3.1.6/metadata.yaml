  Couchbase instrumentation is owned upstream. This Couchbase instrumentation works by intercepting
  the constructor of the CoreEnvironment.Builder class. On construction, it automatically sets the
  Couchbase requestTracer to use an OpenTelemetryRequestTracer that wraps the agent's
  TracerProvider. This enables distributed tracing for Couchbase operations using OpenTelemetry,
  without requiring manual configuration by the user.
