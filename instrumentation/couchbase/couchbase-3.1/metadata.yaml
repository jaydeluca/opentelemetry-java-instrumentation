  Couchbase instrumentation is owned upstream. This instrumentation hooks into the
  CoreEnvironment.Builder constructor and automatically sets the Couchbase requestTracer to use an
  OpenTelemetry tracer from the agent. This enables distributed tracing for Couchbase operations
  using OpenTelemetry, without requiring manual configuration by the user.
