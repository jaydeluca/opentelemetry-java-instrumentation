  This instrumentation enables database CLIENT spans and metrics for Couchbase 2.6 operations.
  It automatically traces key-value operations (get, upsert, replace, remove), view queries, 
  N1QL queries, and cluster management operations. Supports Spring Data integration for 
  repositories and templates.
configurations:
  - name: otel.instrumentation.couchbase.experimental-span-attributes
    description: >
      Enables experimental span attributes `couchbase.operation_id` and `couchbase.local.address`.
      Different operation types receive different experimental attributes: key-value operations 
      get both attributes, view queries get only local.address, N1QL queries get only operation_id, 
      and cluster management operations get none.
